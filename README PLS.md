# AquaNox-2-Model-Exporter
Model Exporter for AquaNox 2: Revelation


This is an unfinished exporter, and there is a lot of stuff to finish. You can try this via 3ds Max 2014 (I didn't try it with other versions, but you can try).

I didn't do reverse engineering of msb files (which are models in AN 2), I just found some model files which are not encrypted and contain code of model (they are using msh format, you can find them in AN 2 game files).

So, if anyone who wants to help me, that would be great, cause I am not programmer and I am making this plugin only just for making new content for this game easily.
